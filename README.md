DEBUGGING A JAVA APPLICATION

The skills assessed here are understanding the Java programming language and building a collaborative code project.

This is a data analysis project for the Heme Biotech laboratory to monitor dosages, symptoms, treatments, etc. 

To improve the prediction of their needs, I worked on creating a trend analysis program. 
The program is supposed to describe the symptom and the number of occurrences. 

A list of symptoms is provided (symptoms.txt) but the symptom count was initially incorrect. 
I was then able to identify bugs and fix them like
- exception handling ;
- non-closing of resources ;
- overlapping variables;
- approaching the code so that it is reusable regardless of the number of symptoms to be tracked.
- sorting symptoms in alphabetical order
- development standards (JavaDoc, unnecessary comments, object-oriented, simple and readable code, etc.)

Finally, for a project like this, I used GitFlow.
